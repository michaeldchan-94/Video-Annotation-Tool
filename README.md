This repo contains two python CLI tools:

# Video Annotator:
This opens an interactive window that allows users to label a single object of interest and track it across the length of the video

Inputs:
- Path to the video
- (Optional) Path to output directory  
    - if no output directory is given, it will default to the same directory that the given video file is in

Output:
- This will output an annotation file following the form `<video-name>.annotations`
- The annotation file consists of line by line annotations, with each line corresponding to that frame number

Annotations adhere to the following format:
```
V 224 746 108 227
I -1 -1 -1 -1
S -1 -1 -1 -1
```
Where `V` means the object is visible, `I` is that the object is currently invisible, and `S` means that the frame was skipped


To run:
```
pip install uv
uv sync
uv run VideoAnnotator.py /path/to/your/video/ --output /optional/path/to/output/directory/ --prompt "optional prompt here"
```

# AnnotationValidator:
This opens up an interactive window that allows users to playback the annotations generated by the VideoAnnotator tool

Inputs:
- Path to the video
- (Optional) Path to annotation file (`video-name.annotations`)
    - if no output directory is given, it will default to the same directory that the given video file is in

To run:
```
pip install uv
uv sync
uv run Validate_Annotation.py /path/to/your/video/ --output /optional/path/to/output/annotation/file/
```
